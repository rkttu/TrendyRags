                Shipping
            </div>
            Orders within the United States are shipped by the US Postal Service (Priority Mail)
            which takes 3-5 business days depending on your location in the US. Your order will
            usually ship within 3-7 business days after you receive an emailed confirmation
            by Trendyrags.com of your order. Trendyrags.com does not ship to PO boxes. We can
            only ship to your credit card billing address for security reasons. If you would
            like to ship to a different address you will need to call your credit card company
            and have them add an alternate address to your card. We will make all efforts to
            ship your order within 3-7 business days of receipt. We do not ship on Saturdays
            and Sundays. All orders placed on Saturday and Sunday will be processed that following
            Monday. During the holidays and Sundays, our order processing time may increase.
