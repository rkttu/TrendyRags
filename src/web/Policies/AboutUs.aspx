        <div style="padding: 10px 30px 20px 30px; line-height:30px;">
            The vintage and rock-inspired designs of LA-based Motor City Legends (MCL) has redefined the motorcycle culture saturated in fashion today. <br /><br />
            Appealing to hipster teens, trendy 20-somethings and chic baby boomers alike, 
            MCL plays with classic biker skull, crossbone, and rose elements by adding its own modern twist. <br /><br />
            Prints are featured on custom, soft-washed and specially dyed hoodies, t-shirts and thermals that 
            are soft to touch and made for comfort.<br /><br />
            For a splash of elegance, special edition looks are adorned with hand-placed Swarovski and Exclusive crystals. <br /><br />
            With a strong and rapidly-growing customer base, MCL has proven in less than one year's time to be a current and continuing force in the upscale, casual wear market.
